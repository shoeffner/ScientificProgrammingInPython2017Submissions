# Scientific Programming in Python 2017 â€“ shoeffner

This repository contains some crude submissions I made to the
class Scientific Programming in Python during the summer term 2017.

I only submitted some exercises and mostly to get an idea of what they looked
like. Do not take any solutions as being complete or useful to you at all.
